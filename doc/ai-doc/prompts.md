your goal is to create alvamind lib below, but first architect the plan in plan.md . also,

1. I want there is no oop or classes in that lib
2. prioritize passing trough what is already exist in fp-ts instead of recreating features.
3. no any or unknown usage. fully leverege typescript infering type.
4. again, implement generic metaprogramming typescript
5. prioritize leveraging bun utilities
6. every file should have bun test file
7. understand below documentations first so you know the expected outcome







your goal is to create unit test lists of alvamind lib below, but first architect the unit test plan in unit-test.plan.md . understand below documentations first so you know the expected outcome
